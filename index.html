    <p>
      Flocking is the ubiquitous emergent behavior observed in birds,
      herd animals, and fish schools.
      Flocking is a type of <em>emergent behavior</em> that emerges from interactions
      between individuals.
      By far the majority of flocking simulations use a set of rules proposed by
      Craig Reynolds in his
      <a href="https://www.red3d.com/cwr/boids/">1987 SIGGRAPH paper</a>.
      These rules are:
    </p>
      <ul>
        <li> Collision Avoidance: don't collide with nearby agents
        <li> Velocity Matching: match the velocity of nearby agents
        <li> Flock Centering: stay close to nearby agents
      </ul>
    <p>
      I will refer to algorithms that are based on these
      three rules as <em>Reynolds flocking</em>.
      The agents in these systems are referred to as <em>boids</em> (a
      contraction of bird-oids).
    </p>

    <p>
      What follows is my experience with flocking, and some techniques that might
      be useful for applications in robotics, computer science, and video games.
      Mathematically-minded readers may be interseted in the flocking review paper
      linked in the header.

    <h1>Reynolds Flocking and Potential Fields</h1>

    <p>
      A natural way to implement Reynolds Flocking is through artificial
      potential fields.
      Potential fields describe many physical forces, and are commonly used to
      decribe electrical forces and fluid interactions.
      These potential fields are artificial because they have nothing to do with
      the physical forces acting on the boids, and are instead used to control their
      motion.
      The implementation is straignforward, two of the flocking rules are
      assigned a virtual force based on the distance to nearby boids:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li> Push away from nearby boids; pushing force decreases with distance
      <li> Pull toward distant boids; pulling force decreases with distance
    </ul>

    <p>
      The following javascript demo applies potential fields and velocity
      alignment to a flock of 25 boids.
      The first slider controls the sensing horizon of each boid-this determines
      which boids are considered <em>nearby</em>.
      The second slider weighs the influence of the potential field (collision
      avoidance and flock centering) against velocity alignment.
      Moving the second slider to the left prioritizes the potential
      field, and moving it to the right prioritizes velocity alignment.
    </p>
